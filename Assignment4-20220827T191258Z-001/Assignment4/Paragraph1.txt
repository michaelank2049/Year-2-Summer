Sandy was driving down the road to her friends house when she saw a dog on the side of the road. Afraid that it would run out into the road and get hit by another car, she stopped and tried to move it away from the road. The dog wouldn't listen and instead jumped into her car. She decided to adopt the dog and they lived happily ever after.
